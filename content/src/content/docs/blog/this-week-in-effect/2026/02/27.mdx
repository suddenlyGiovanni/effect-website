Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers build complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect v4 Beta](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/40-beta/) Release! 🚀
- [Effect AI SDK](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/releases/tag/%40effect%2Fai%400.27.0) Release.
- Durable workflows in TypeScript with [`@effect/workflow`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/workflow/README.md) - currently in alpha.
- 6130+ community members on [Discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts).

## Technology

### Effect v4 Beta Updates

The v4 beta has been evolving rapidly since launch — here are the most notable changes that landed this week in effect-smol.

- **[New `Tx` modules & transaction model refactored](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1515)**, improving consistency and ergonomics across transactional workflows.
- **Schema improvements**: added `Schema.makeOption` / `SchemaParser.makeOption `for constructing schema values as `Option`, introduced `OptionFromUndefinedOr` and `OptionFromNullishOr`, and fixed `Schema.encodeKeys` to correctly encode non-remapped struct fields.
- **OpenAPI & HTTP fixes**: multipart file upload schema fixed in OpenAI and OpenAI JSON schemas correctly transformed for AI integrations.
- **CLI bug fix**: resolved global flag handling in mixed CLI contexts.

You can follow the full changelog directly in the [effect-smol repository](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol).
